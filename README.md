Murtignip
========================

A Node.js client for consuming Gnip. Connect to the Gnip Powertrack Streaming API and manage your rules. You **must have a**
**Gnip account** with Twitter PowerTrack available and enabled.

## Murtignip.Powertrack.Stream
The stream is an EventEmitter that allows you to connect to a PowerTrack stream and start receiving data.

### API Methods

#### stream.start()
Connect to the stream and start receiving data from Gnip. You should have registered at least one event listener for any
of the following events from the stream:

- data
- share
- post

#### stream.end()
Terminates the connection to the stream.

### Events
| Event Name | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| data       | Emitted for each content item received. |
| error      | Emitted when the response received is not a 200 OK. |
| end        | Emitted when the stream has been ended. |
| post       | Emitted for each content item received that has a _verb_ value of `post`. |
| share      | Emitted for each content item received that has a _verb_ value of `share`. |
